# Iris-flower-classification using instance based -> K nearest neighbor algorithm 

I am using iris.csv dataset for the classification.

The algorithm is implemented from scratch without using scikit-learn.

Wiki link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

The problem is comprised of 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species.

Classification is done on features:
1. sepal length
2. sepal width
3. petal length
4. petal width (all in the same unit of centimeters).

The predicted attribute is the species, which is one of Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor or Iris-virginica.
